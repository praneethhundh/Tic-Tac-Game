# Tic-Tac-Game
Enjoy classic Tic-Tac-Toe with this web-based game. Players take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid by clicking cells. The game tracks the current player, detects wins based on horizontal, vertical, and diagonal alignments, and announces the winner or a draw. Responsive design ensures it adapts to different screen sizes, providing a simple and enjoyable experience. A reset button allows players to start a new game at any time.
# Devloping stages
Development began with designing the game's HTML structure, including a grid layout and interactive cells. CSS was then applied for styling, focusing on a clean interface with responsive design principles. JavaScript handled game logic, initializing variables for player turns and tracking game state. Functions were created to handle cell clicks, check for win conditions using arrays of winning combinations, and determine game outcomes such as wins or draws. Error handling and user feedback were incorporated to ensure smooth gameplay. Finally, a reset button was added to allow players to restart the game, completing the development process.
